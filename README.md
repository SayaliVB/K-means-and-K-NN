# K-means-and-K-NN

1. Assigning clusters using K-means/K-mean++ clustering algorithm.

Implement K-means clustering and K-means++ algorithm from scratch.
Find the optimum K (the number of clusters) using elbow method.
Assign each data point to the corresponding clusters.

2. Assigning class using K-NN classification algorithm.

Assume the resultant clusters from problem #1 are representing each class.
Assign class for each data point from cluster_data2.csv file using K-NN method.
Assume K equals to 5 in K-NN method.
